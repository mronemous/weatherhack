# CATASTROMAP

Response times can be as quick, but if rescuers don't know what they're getting into, they may not be able to help out to the most effective extent.

Our app overlays live weather data over a layer of data which can represent people most affected by whichever type of weather is coming through. 

Simultaneously, our server-side service constantly checks to see if any weather event has occurred near people who may be sensitive to that evet. 

This is a proactive planning tool for before, after, and during a storm to help guide the right supplies and help to the right regions based on data instead of waiting for feedback.



# Why? How? 

An app which asks a user for information may run into a few different types of problems:
 - Users may over or understate how much help they actually need
 - Users may no longer have access to connectivity or electricity
 - Users may not want to download an app, or know how to use it
 
Realistically, we can figure out what regions have people who may be in trouble with freely available datasets and a geospatial database.
